# Coding Katas
Taken from [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/@MizouziE) and [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/MizouziE)

## What and why
A collection of exercises to practice thinking like a programmer. Those from Laracasts were a nice place to start and the added challenge of getting those taken from codewars to function as part of the whole set up has helped develop understanding of PHPUnit.

Those from Laracasts were done with a *TDD* approach before being refactored while *TDD* was adopted later on during the progressive inclusion of CodeWars katas, particularly katas ranked **5kyu** and higher.

Just wanted to play around with writing markdown a little. Let's hope all the fancy bits work first time and I won't need to do multiple commits! :joy:
